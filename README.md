RefineryGems.org
================

I was always going to rubygems or google after the official refinerycms engines page to see if there were other gems that were not listed there.

I also wanted to play with Sinatra and Heroku and see how fast I could make this app with a bit of free time

So, this app uses the RubyGems.org JSON API, the HTTParty gem and Sinatra to get 'er done.

CSS and other contributions welcome, you can share the glory!

MIT license, do what you want, don't blame me.
